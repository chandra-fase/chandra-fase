During this program I gained experience on more than 17 technical projects, processing competencies in business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and ML. I am eager to leverage big data and visualization skills in the Marketing & Advertising sphere, with the aim of driving growth and boosting sales. 

I currently have five years of Marketing and three years of Real Estate experience. With these past experiences, I have gained important skills needed in the technology world including; being a self-starter, time management, attention to detail, multitasking, and being able to communicate with a variety of individuals.</p>
